1. Pair Sum / Two Sum – Sorted

Problem:
Sorted array kuduthiruppanga.
target sum kedaikanuma nu check pannu.

Example:
Input: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10], target = 9
Output: pairs → (4,5), (3,7)

👉 Two pointer: left = 0, right = n-1

2. Check if array is palindrome

Input: "malayalam"
Two pointers compare from ends.

3. Reverse array using two pointers

Left→Right swap.

4. Remove duplicates from sorted array

Two-pointer stable overwrite.

🔥 Level 2 – Medium (Pointer movement based on condition)
5. Container With Most Water (LeetCode #11)

Tall bottles → max area find pannum.

👉 Two pointer:
if(height[left] < height[right]) left++; else right--;

6. 3Sum Closest

Array sorted.
Three numbers sum → target-ukku closest.

👉 Outer loop for i
👉 Inside two pointer

7. Sum of Two Values < K (count pairs)

Condition-based pointer shifting.

8. Count number of pairs with absolute difference = k
🔥 Level 3 – Hard (Two-pointer + Sorting logic)
9. 3Sum (nee ippo padichathu)

Full two-pointer mastery.

10. 4Sum

Similar but two loops + two-pointer.

11. Longest Substring without repeating characters

Sliding window (two-pointer variant).

12. Trapping Rain Water

Two pointer alternate movement.

🔥 Bonus: Special Two-Pointer Questions

These check deep understanding:

13. Move all zeros to end without changing order

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Two pointers: slow (write), fast (scan).

14. Partition array: negative on left, positive on right

Two-pointer swap logic.

15. Find longest mountain in array

Up + down sweeps.
